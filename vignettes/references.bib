abstract = {Panel models in structural equation modeling that combine static and dynamic components make it possible to investigate reciprocal relations while controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity.Recently, the latent curve model with structured residuals and the random-intercept cross-laggedpanel model were suggested as “residual-level” versions of the more traditional autoregressive latent trajectoryand dynamic panel models, respectively. Their main benefit is that they allow for a morestraightforward interpretation of the trajectory factors. It is not widely known, however, that the residual-level models place potentially strong assumptions on the initial conditions—that is, the process thatwas occurring before the observation period began. If the process under investigation is not both stationaryand at equilibrium then the residual-level models are not appropriate. They then do not control forall time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and can result in biased cross-lagged and autoregressiveestimates. I demonstrate this using the problem behavior of cigarette smoking among adolescents:Because the mean and variance of this process changes as a young person's smoking behavior develops,early stages of this process should not be examined using the residual-level models. This issue potentiallyexists for a wide variety of psychological and sociological subjects, essentially whenever theprocess under investigation is changing over the course of the observation period. This article discussesstrategies to help researchers decide which model to use when, and compares some of their relativeadvantages and drawbacks. An amendment to the residual-level models is suggested in which the latentindividual effects are allowed to covary with the initial residuals. This makes the residual-level modelsrobust to violations of the assumptions surrounding the initial conditions, while retaining their otherbeneficial aspects},

abstract = {Although it takes time for a cause to exert an effect, causal models often fail to allow adequately for time lags. In particular, causal models that contain cross-sectional relations (i.e., relations between values of 2 variables at the same time) are unsatisfactory because they omit the values of variables at prior times, they omit effects that variables can have on themselves, and they fail to specify the length of the causal interval that is being studied. These omissions can produce severe biases in estimates of the size of causal effects. Longitudinal models also can fail to take account of time lags properly, and this too can lead to severely biased estimates. The discussion illustrates the biases that can occur in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models, introduces the latent longitudinal approach to causal modeling, and shows how latent longitudinal models can be used to reduce bias by taking account of time lags even when data are available for only 1 point in time.},

@article{Hamaker2005,
abstract = {Curran and Bollen combined two models for longitudinal panel data: the latent growth curve model and the autoregressive model. In their model, the autoregressive relationships are modeled between the observed variables. This is a different model than a latent growth curve model with autoregressive relationships between the disturbances. However, when the autoregressive parameter is invariant over time and lies between-1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth curve model with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth curve model with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters.},

While this advice seems plausible, little empirical support appears to exist. A previous study by Jackson (2001), failed to find support for this hypothesis, however, there were certain limitations to the study that likely led to the lack of findings. This study revisits the issue with a design modified to be more sensitive to practically significant effects of sample size to parameter estimate ratio. Consequently, some support was found for this hypothesis, notably among overall fit measures and tests. Results indicate that higher values of the observations per parameter ratio had a positive effect for some measures of fit. However, the overall effectwas small relative to absolute sample size. {\textcopyright} 2003, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.},

Based on classical and contemporary theories, a strong link between alienation and amotivation was predicted. A cross-sectional correlation study (Study 1) found that SA significantly predicted AA controlling for relevant variables (e.g., self-efficacy). A four-wave longitudinal design (Study 2) tested the reciprocal relationship between SA and AA within persons. Contrary to the a priori hypothesis that SA would predict amotivation, the path from AA to SA was more consistent and reliable than the other path. The potential bidirectional links between SA and AA, implications, and future directions are discussed.},

However, it is well known that CLPMs can lead to different parameter estimates depending on the time-interval of observation. Consequently, this can lead to researchers drawing conflicting conclusions regarding the sign and/or dominance of relationships. Multiple authors have suggested the use of continuous-time models to address this issue. In this article, we demonstrate the exact circumstances under which such conflicting conclusions occur. Specifically, we show that such conflicts are only avoided in general in the case of bivariate, stable, nonoscillating, first-order systems, when comparing models with uniform time-intervals between observations. In addition, we provide a range of tools, proofs, and guidelines regarding the comparison of discrete- and continuous-time parameter estimates.},

Accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE) has taken on increasing importance in light of recent emphasis on effect size estimation and formation of confidence intervals.

@article{Ozkok2021,
abstract = {Researchers often combine longitudinal panel data analysis with tests of interactions (i.e., moderation). A popular example is the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). However, interaction tests in CLPMs and related models require caution because stable (i.e., between-level, B) and dynamic (i.e., within-level, W) sources of variation are present in longitudinal data, which can conflate estimates of interaction effects. We address this by integrating literature on CLPMs, multilevel moderation, and latent interactions. Distinguishing stable B and dynamic W parts, we describe three types of interactions that are of interest to researchers: 1) purely dynamic or WxW; 2) cross-level or BxW; and 3) purely stable or BxB. We demonstrate estimating latent interaction effects in a CLPM using a Bayesian SEM in Mplus to apply relationships among work-family conflict and job satisfaction, using gender as a stable B variable. We support our approach via simulations, demonstrating that our proposed CLPM approach is superior to a traditional CLPMs that conflate B and W sources of variation. We describe higher-order nonlinearities as a possible extension, and we discuss limitations and future research directions.},

abstract = {Inferring reciprocal effects or causality between variables is a central aim of behavioral and psychological research. To address reciprocal effects, a variety of longitudinal models that include cross-lagged relations have been proposed in different contexts and disciplines. However, the relations between these cross-lagged models have not been systematically discussed in the literature. This lack of insight makes it difficult for researchers to select an appropriate model when analyzing longitudinal data, and some researchers do not even think about alternative cross-lagged models. The present research provides a unified framework that clarifies the conceptual and mathematical similarities and differences between these models. The unified framework shows that existing longitudinal models can be effectively classified based on whether the model posits unique factors and/or dynamic residuals and what types of common factors are used to model changes. The latter is essential to understand how cross-lagged parameters are interpreted. We also present an example using empirical data to demonstrate that there is great},

Also, more power can be gained when informative hypotheses are tested directly. In this paper we will (a) compare the results of traditional analyses with the results of this novel methodology; (b) introduce applied researchers to the parametric bootstrap procedure for the evaluation of informative hypotheses; and (c) provide the results of a simulation study to demonstrate power gains when using inequality constraints. We argue that researchers should directly evaluate inequality-constrained hypotheses if there is a strong theory about the ordering of relevant parameters. In this way, researchers can make use of all knowledge available from previous investigations, while also learning more from their data compared to traditional null-hypothesis testing. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad "lessons learned" for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Starting with a cross-lagged approach, this paper builds a general cross-lagged panel model (GCLM) with parameters to account for stable factors while increasing the range of dynamic processes that can be modeled. We illustrate the GCLM by examining the relationship between national income and subjective well-being (SWB), showing how to examine hypotheses about short-run (via Granger-Sims tests) versus long-run effects (via impulse responses). When controlling for stable factors, we find no short-run or long-run effects among these variables, showing national SWB to be relatively stable, whereas income is less so. Our second paper addresses the differences between the GCLM and other methods. Online Supplementary Materials offer an Excel file automating GCLM input for Mplus (with an example also for Lavaan in R) and analyses using additional data sets and all program input/output. We also offer an introductory GCLM presentation at https://youtu.be/tHnnaRNPbXs. We conclude with a discussion of issues surrounding causal inference.},

We then describe "dynamic" models that incorporate temporal dynamics in the form of lagged effects: cross-lagged models estimated in a structural equation model (SEM) or multilevel model (MLM) framework; Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data methods; and autoregressive latent trajectory models. We describe the implications of overlooking temporal dynamics in static models and show how even popular cross-lagged models fail to control for stable factors over time. We also show that Arellano-Bond and autoregressive latent trajectory models have various shortcomings. By contrasting these approaches, we clarify the benefits and drawbacks of common methods for modeling panel data, including the GCLM approach we propose.
