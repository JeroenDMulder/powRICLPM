## Resubmission 2
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the Description field of the `powRICLPM()` function such that it now starts with a capital letter (i.e., I deleted the redundant package name in the beginning).

* Used `\doi{}` for DOI's in the `powRICLPM()` documentation. 

* Created a `@references` field for references contained in the `powRICLPM()` documentation.

There were 2 NOTEs, which can be safely ignored:

* "CLPM" and "powRICLPM" are not misspelled words in DESCRIPTION.

* The "(possibly) invalid DOI" refers to the paper detailing the method as implemented in this package. It is currently in press, but once published is available at the included doi.

## Resubmission 1
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a trailing slash to the URL in the DESCRIPTION file.

* Extended the Description in the DESCRIPTION file and included a reference about the method implemented in this package. Note that this article is currently in press, but once published online is available at the included doi. 

* Changed an invalid URL in the package startup message.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* This is a new release.
