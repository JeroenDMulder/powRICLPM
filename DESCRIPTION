Description: `powRICLPM` performs user-friendly power analyses for the bivariate 
  random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM). It implements the strategy 
  as proposed by Mulder (in press). Further power analysis options include the 
  use of bounded estimation, inclusion of measurement error in the data 
  generating model and estimation model (i.e., the stable trait autoregressive 
  trait state, STARTS, model), imposing various constraints over time on the 
  parameters of the estimation model, among others. References: Mulder (in press)
